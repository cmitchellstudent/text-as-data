    "- Typically, a corpus can be broken down into categories (or genres) of documents, which can emerge as principal components, centroids, neighborhoods, etc.\n",
    "- Corpora can be text (data) only or they can contain metadata: the titles of novels, the date a tweet was published, the name of the user who posted the TikTok, the subreddit in which a post appeared, the number of comments or like any of these have received."

    "- How do we do it: scraping, RSS ingestion, API, finding a raw text corpus already out there. (See: Kaggle, Harvard Dataverse, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "The elephant in the room is **copyright**. The reason so much work is done with older books is that they are out of copyright. Getting access to contemporary books is difficult and/or expensive and is largely the purview of well-funded institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next issue is quality. Most older materials have been digitized, which means a picture of the page was taken and then run through optical character recognition software (OCR). Some texts are more thoroughly checked than others. (Crowd-sourcing can vary: it all depends on the community.) \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a real rush to digitize things in the 2000s and 2010s, but those efforts were often underfunded and underconsidered. E.g., Louisiana Digital Library is kind of a mess. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use resources from under-resourced agencies and organizations, but it does mean that you should do hand-checking. (Depending on size, you may want to find a way to give your material either a thorough check or a considered random check.) OCR scanning erros can lead ro signals that are weak or just plain wrong.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes CLI tools, like `wget`, are more powerful than GUI tools. The key difference is that GUI tools are easier to use at first, but repetitive tasks are difficult or expensive (in terms of time). CLI tools are a little more difficult at first, but once you have an established collection of them, they are not only easier to use but just plain easier. \n",

    "\n",
    "* `wget` is the program we are going to use. It wants to know where to go and how to proceed.\n",
    "* `-r` (or `--recursive`) turns on recursive retrieving (up to 5 directories deep). \n",
    "* `-l 1` (or`--level=1`) keeps the depth to 1.\n",
    "* `-w 2` gives the amount of time to wait between retrievals. (Two seconds lessens the server load.)\n",
    "* `--limit-rate=20k` sets the retrieval rate to 20kB/s. (This is being polite in a shared connection setting.)\n",
    "\n",
    "K.M. Kinnaird and I used `wget` to \"crawl\" the TED website and download transcripts, talk and speaker descriptions, and comments pages. I have also used it, as the URL in the example above suggests, to grab the texts of Grimms' fairy tales.
